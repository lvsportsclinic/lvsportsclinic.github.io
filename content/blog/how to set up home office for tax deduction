How to Set Up a Home Office

If you run your business from a space set aside in your home and keep good records, the home office deduction may be the biggest single deduction you can take. Here are the proper steps to setting up your home office.

Step 1: Pick a space

 - You can use a portion of a room as a home office, but be sure the personal spaces are clearly separate from the business space.
 - Your home office must be the primary area where your business activities take place.
 - When furnishing your home office, you should have only those decorative items that would be appropriate for a "real" office or cubicle - if you wouldn't have something in a real office, it shouldn't be in your home office.
 - Your desk, computer, filing cabinets, shipping area (if you have one) should all be part of your home office space.
 - You can have a stereo system in your home office (which you can deduct), as well as appropriate artwork (which you cannot deduct if it's a collectible that will hold or increase its value or over time).
 - You CANNOT have cribs, kitchen or bathroom items in your home office unless you are running a daycare business from home.

Storing Inventory

 - If you use areas in your basement or attic as storage space for your inventory, you can add it to your home office space to take the deduction.
 - You CANNOT deduct your entire basement, though, if you use only a portion of that space to store inventory.
 - The solution? Duct tape! Use it to set the boundaries of the "business" portion of your basement or attic, so that if you are ever audited, the IRS agent can see clearly where your home office space ends and your personal space begins.

Note: Rarely will an auditor make a home visit. Photographs of your office should suffice.

Step 2: Measure Your Home Office

To take the home office deduction, you should know the square footage of both your entire home (wall to wall) and your home office space.
 - Don't do the measuring yourself, as it's easy to make mistakes (usually not in your favor).
 - Instead, have a contractor measure your home office space professionally, and give you something in writing with the exact measurements in case you are ever audited.

Step 3: Calculate Your Home Office Percentage

 - This is a fraction - the numerator (top number) is the square footage of your home office space, while the denominator (bottom number) is the square footage of your entire home (wall to wall).
 - So, for example, if your home office space is 1,000 square feet, and your entire home is 4,000 square feet, your "home office percentage" is 1/4th or 25%.

Step 4: Start Deducting

 - If you have a home office, you can deduct your home office percentage from just about all of your household expenses (such as taxes, utilities, housecleaning fees, etc.).
 - If you own your home, you can also depreciate it for tax purposes.
 - You CANNOT deduct expenses (such as lawn care and gardening) for activities that take place outside of the home, since by definition a "home office" must be "within" a home.

Some special rules:

 - You cannot deduct more than the net profit your business makes each year (but like other operating losses, you can carry these forward into future tax years).
 - You must fill out Form 8829 and submit it with your 1040 each year. (We'll help you do that.)
 - If you depreciate your home as part of the home office deduction and then sell your home at a profit, you will have to pay a 25% capital gains tax on the total depreciation deductions you took while you were living there (this tax does NOT apply to other deductions you took).

Step 5: Keep Good Records

While the home office deduction is typically not an "audit trigger," you do have to keep good records, such as:
 - Copies of Form 1098 showing the interest you paid on your mortgage each year
 - Property tax bills (and cancelled checks)
 - Utility and insurance bills
 - A copy of your lease (if you rent)
